This repository is for the code of the ICASSP 2026 paper: "Robust Kalman Filter for Additive Gaussian-Student's t Distribution".




## Acknowledgement
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Prof. Zhenyu and Prof. Xiao-Ping for their invaluable research guidance and insightful revision feedback on this manuscript.

This work originated from my course project on "Bayesian Learning". I have since further developed and expanded upon that early version. I would also like to thank our course teacher, Prof. Ercan, and the technical assistant, Dr. Pengcheng, for their valuable input and assistance during and after the course.
